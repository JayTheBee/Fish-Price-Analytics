# Fish Price Analytics
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the over all economy in many sectors such as agriculture. In this study, the researcher analyzes the prices of fish commodities being sold in Metro Manila during the pandemic lockdowns. Using the relevant time series methodologies such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), the researcher establishes the hypothesis that the COVID-19 lockdowns have an impact on these prices. Based on the studyâ€™s findings, the fish commodities were affected by the lockdowns in specified months and even in the entire duration of the lockdown from October 1, 2019 to August 31, 2021.
